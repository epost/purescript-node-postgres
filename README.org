#+title: PureScript bindings for node-postgres

This is an initial experiment in providing bindings to the [[https://www.npmjs.org/package/pg][pg library]] ([[https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres][node-postgres]] on GitHub). It's currently in pre-alpha state. In fact, if a letter existed before alpha, I would have chosen that.

* Installation

I'll assume you have [[http://www.purescript.org/][PureScript]] and [[http://www.postgresql.org/][PostgreSQL]] installed. You'll also need [[https://github.com/bodil/pulp][purescript-pulp]] and [[https://www.npmjs.org/package/pg][pg]]:

#+begin_src bash
npm install pg
npm install -g pulp
#+end_src

Clone the project:

#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/epost/purescript-node-postgres
cd purescript-node-postgres
#+end_src

Create a Postgres database and run the tests:

#+begin_src bash
psql --command="create database test"
cat schema.sql | psql --username=testuser test
#+end_src

* Building and running

Let's run some tests:

#+begin_src bash
pulp install
pulp test
#+end_src

* Documentation

See [[file:./MODULE.md][Module documentation]].
